# Its BETA there will be issues and lackign features :)
 - Download https://github.com/esge/PoE-HarvestVendor/releases/tag/0.2.2
 - Requires AHK 1.1.33.02 
   - not that it wont work on older, but there was a bug where it would say that a piece of code is unreachable in a switch/case and you will get a warning popup everytime you launch it
   - the error message it shows on older versions is:   
        Warning: This line will never execute, due to Return precceding it
